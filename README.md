# MLE

This repo includes practical tasks for assignments in the **MLE course** (ITPU - Epam):

- **Task 1: Core Machine Learning Techniques**  
  Basics of ML models like regression, decision trees, and random forests, with practice on structured datasets.  

- **Task 2: Advanced Machine Learning Topics**  
  Ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost) and neural networks (LeNet on CIFAR-10), focusing on model comparison and training.  

- **Task 3: Specialized Topics**  
  Modern areas of ML including NLP with BERT, Generative Models (GANs/VAEs), and Reinforcement Learning.
