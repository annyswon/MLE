## MLE Specialized Topics

This task covers three areas: **NLP**, **Generative Models**, and **Reinforcement Learning (bonus)**.

## Part 1: NLP (50 pts)
- Theory: embeddings, attention in transformers, BERT vs GPT, RNN vs LSTM vs GRU.  
- Practical: fine-tune BERT on IMDb sentiment dataset. Extract `[CLS]` embeddings and train Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Report accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC curves. Save trained models.  

## Part 2: Generative Models (50 pts)
- Theory: compare GANs vs VAEs, diffusion process, roles of generator/discriminator.  
- Practical: train a GAN (DCGAN-style) on **CelebA** to generate 64Ã—64 face images.  

## Part 3: Reinforcement Learning (Bonus, 15 pts)
- Theory: what is RL vs supervised learning. Define RL components for a self-driving car (agent, environment, state, action, reward, policy, value, model).  

## Tools
Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Google Colab.  

**Deliverables:** Notebooks with code + markdown answers, trained models, evaluation results.
